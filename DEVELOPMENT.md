# 🛡️ DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES & PROJECT RULES

**⚠️ CRITICAL: This file contains the 12 immutable project rules that MUST be followed by ALL AI agents and developers working on this codebase. These rules supersede any other documentation or preferences.**

---

## 📋 THE 12 IMMUTABLE PROJECT RULES

### 🔴 RULE 1: FOUNDATION FEATURES
**NEVER change any foundational features or functions without explicit user acknowledgement. This includes core chat functionality, file processing, plugin systems, or any existing user workflows.**

### 🔴 RULE 2: PRODUCTION QUALITY
**NEVER skip, shortcut, or "dumb down" tasks for ease. Full production-ready code is required at all times. No exceptions for complexity or difficulty.**

### 🔴 RULE 3: COMPLETE REFACTORING
**Identify and refactor ALL incomplete code/modules/mocks for production readiness. This includes removing ALL simulated logic, mock data, and placeholder implementations.**

### 🔴 RULE 4: CODEBASE STREAMLINING
**Minimize codebase sprawl by continuously removing unnecessary files, duplicates, and backups as you work. Maintain a lean, efficient codebase.**

### 🔴 RULE 5: TOKEN LIMIT STRATEGY
**Use efficient strategies to overcome token/context limits (chunking/merging files), but ensure a streamlined final codebase. Never leave fragmented code.**

### 🔴 RULE 6: CLARIFICATION OVER ASSUMPTION
**Always clarify uncertainties with the user rather than making assumptions. When in doubt, ask for explicit confirmation.**

### 🔴 RULE 7: EFFICIENT WORKFLOW
**Work tasks in the most efficient order for project and workflow efficiency. Do not ask what to work on next - prioritize based on project needs.**

### 🔴 RULE 8: VISUAL TASK TRACKING
**Maintain a visually stunning, graphical task list file for live IDE updates. This dashboard must remain current and visually appealing.**

### 🔴 RULE 9: DOCUMENTATION CONSISTENCY
**Consistently update documentation for seamless agent transitions. Every change must be documented for the next developer.**

### 🔴 RULE 10: RULE EVOLUTION
**Add any new rules/requirements to this list as they arise. This document must evolve with the project.**

### 🔴 RULE 11: 100% GOAL COMPLETION
**Ensure 100% goal completion. No returning to address troublesome tasks/issues/fixes unless explicitly advised. Complete everything the first time.**

### 🔴 RULE 12: NEXT-GEN INNOVATION
**Target next-gen/futuristic GUI with bleeding-edge components and innovative workflow design, while maintaining production stability.**

## 🎯 BACK-BURNER FEATURES (Future Scope)

**The following features are intentionally deferred for post-production implementation:**

### 🧠 BCI/Neural Interface Integration
- Brain-computer interface support
- Neural signal processing
- Thought-based command execution
- **Status**: Post-production, after core stability achieved

### 🔐 Advanced Biometric Authentication
- Facial recognition integration
- Voiceprint authentication
- Heartbeat biometric verification
- **Status**: Post-production, after security foundation established

### ⚛️ Quantum Computing Support
- Quantum-enhanced AI processing
- Quantum cryptography integration
- Quantum algorithm optimization
- **Status**: Post-production, after classical computing optimization complete
